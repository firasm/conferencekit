# Venue

The conference venue is integral to ensuring that the conference or learning event is welcoming, safe, and inclusive. The committee will most likely have a limited number of options and some restrictions in terms of budget and timing, but it is important to take the following logistical aspects of the event as central to the planning process. Being aware of the accessibility features and/or limitations of the venue can help you to communicate clearly to the participants and anticipate any challenges that might arise. 

## Choosing a Venue

When choosing a venue, consider the space and possible uses and barriers from as many angles as possible. In particular, you might use your analysis of the gaps and barriers in your own field (such as unconscious bias) to address who might have been excluded from participation in the past. This will most likely include racialized, Indigenous, gender diverse, and physically and invisibly disabled people as well as people who are parenting, graduate students and contract faculty on limited budgets. 

- What accessibility protocols, processes, procedures, structures are already in place?
- Can the venue provide spaces for rest and reflection, family gatherings, informal connection?
- Can child care be supported either within or close to the venue?
- Are there accessible washrooms for people with a range of identities and needs?
- Will the venue allow for a barrier free flow between the events on the program schedule: or would people need to navigate inaccessible building structures, transportation, etc.?
- What kind of technical supports are provided by the venue?

## Rooms

The venue's rooms for presentations, networking, entertainment, meals must be accessible to all participants. 
You will want to ensure the following:
•	there are accessible means (elevators, lifts, ramps) for travelling from one room or floor to another 
•	rooms are large enough for a range of mobilities such as wheelchair users
•	all presenters can access the podium/stage
•	large rooms have a sound system: microphones, etc.
•	rooms are not located near roadways, construction, mechanical equipment or have overhead lighting that creates noise and distractions that might cause disturbances for attendees.

## Washrooms

Access to washrooms will be very important to the wellbeing of the event's participants. Ensure that there are accessible washrooms for disabled individuals as well as gender neutral washrooms and washrooms with change tables. If there are no gender neutral washrooms then you can create signage to assign one washroom as a gender neutral space. 


## Transportation

When reviewing the accessibility of the venue's transportation consider people with mobility challenges (E.g. wheelchair users) as well as other kinds of conditions that might require extra planning. 

- Ensure the venue is reachable by accessible public or private transportation 
- Provide specific information and instructions on:
- the accessibility of transportation options
- suggested taxi companies or other safe travel options
- how to pay, where to find schedules
- hot to travel to/from airports, ports, trainstations 
- who to contact for further assistance

## Parking

When reviewing the accessibility of the venue's parking ensure that you consider people with mobility challenges (E.g. wheelchair users) as well as other kinds of conditions that might make driving the preferable option. Provide detailed information to the participants on the locations of accessible parking.
