# Dates & Times

One of the very first decisions you will make after organizing your committee will be to choose the event dates. The dates and times of the event will play a considerable role in ensuring a wide range of people can contribute to the knowledge sharing and learning that is the goal of your event. In making this decision you might consider the following:
- Avoid conflicts with religious, and school holidays as well as mid-term and spring breaks. This will ensure that people from a range of cultural and religious backgrounds as well as those with parenting or caregiving responsibilities can attend. Travelling at these times can also be very expensive and creates barriers for junior scholars and/or graduate students.
- Change the dates instead of holding the conference on the same dates every year. This ensure that people who are excluded by dates one year have the opportunity to attend a following year.
- Announce the dates early so potential participants have plenty of time to make arrangements.
- Plan for an early start and end to each or most days in consideration of those with parenting and caregiving responsibilities and/or those with disabilities.
- Schedule networking sessions and entertainment opportunities at different times of the day. When scheduled at the end of the day many people with parenting or caregiving responsibilites and/or disabilities cannot attend.
