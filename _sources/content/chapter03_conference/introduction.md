# Introduction

Setting the conditions for your event begins with the way in which participants are welcomed and oriented to the conference/learning gathering. At the onset of the conference opening, participants may be required to navigate through a registration centre as well as self-select to explore conference venues, engage with conference organizers, and/or network with other participants.  Within the first hour, participants will have already begun to formulate an opinion of whether the conference/learning gathering will be a safe, inclusive, and welcoming place to learn, collaborate, and network.  Each participantâ€™s notion of accessibility, the openness for inclusivity and respect for diversity will be influenced by what they see, feel, and hear prior to the official opening of a keynote address or session presentations.  That being said, conference organizers are encouraged to create visible signposts, promoting greater inclusivity, from the onset of the conference/learning gathering.
