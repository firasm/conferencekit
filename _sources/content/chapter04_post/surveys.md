# Surveys
Consistent with the principle of relationship-building, surveys disseminated after a conference, symposium or learning gathering should be designed in ways that welcome ongoing dialogue, rather than simply trying to quantify discrete outcomes. 
While acknowledging the value of identifiable and measurable results, our guidelines welcome forms of engagement, critique, and collaborative reflection that may find their most authentic expression in perspectives and understandings that cannot be measured. 
With this in mind, we urge survey designs that make space for both closed (Yes/No) and open-ended (How? What? Why?) questions. 
Organizing committees are also encouraged to explore the feasibility of post-event focus groups, and semi-structured interviews with differently situated participants and stakeholders.
