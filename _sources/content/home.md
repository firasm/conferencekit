# Welcome to the UBC Conference Diversity Toolkit

*As part of the process of constructing this website, we are asking for community feedback on what is needed to create inclusive and diverse conferences, panels, and speakers at UBC. We hope you participate and partner with us on this journey to advance inclusion and equitable access at UBC. [add email link or other medium for input]*

# Designing Inclusive Conferences and Learning Gatherings

```{dropdown} Preface
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-primary text-white font-weight-bold
The University of British Columbia is an institution of learning in two interconnected and interdependent ways. First, we are a community in which people from all parts of the world, and from many different backgrounds, come to live and learn together at UBC on the traditional, ancestral and unceded lands of the Musqueam people, Vancouver campus, and the Syilx people of the Okanagan Nation, Kelowna campus. Second, we are also dedicated to continuous and active institutional learning exchange about systemic inequality and the insidious, sometimes intangible, dynamics of privilege and oppression. We aspire to be an open, expansive, and expanding learning community.

The University of British Columbia is committed to recognizing and honouring the historical and ongoing contributions of equity-deserving groups who have been historically, persistently, or systemically marginalized at the intersections of race, religion, gender, sexuality, class, and disability. As a first step on the long, collective path towards intersectional social justice, we declare solidarity with equity-deserving groups and communities.

```{dropdown} Our mission
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-primary text-white font-weight-bold
Our ultimate goal is to build and sustain institutional capacity for welcoming and retaining researchers, educators, community members, and students from equity-deserving groups. As well, our mission is to center such people in positions of leadership and partnerships from which they have been (and, too often, continue to be) excluded.

We recognize this process requires us to begin with the foundations of institutional structures across and within disciplines and units. The core of our mission is to ensure that learning events (conferences, seminars, congresses, symposiums, etc.) associated with UBC are designed to foster a diversity of ways of knowing, identities, and lived experiences that contribute to all fields and conversations. We commit to do the following:

- Establishing specific actions for reconciliation, including decolonizing educational methodologies and practices and holding space for Indigenous perspectives and knowledges from Indigenous peoples;
- Identifying and removing barriers for equity-deserving groups and individuals
- Identifying leaders and partners, and creating a forum for equity-deserving groups to contribute their lived experiences [2](https://www.sinsinvalid.org/news-1/2020/6/8/access-suggestions-for-public-events)
- Creating and providing resources for conference organizers to recognize and centre the diverse lived experiences, needs, and aspirations of participants
- Creating and providing resources for conference organizers on issues related to diversity, and the benefits for inclusion across the institution, and within disciplines
- Designing conferences that are inclusive, including an environment in which all participants:
    - have the freedom to learn and share knowledge and experiences
    - have access to spaces, supports, and tools needed for that freedom
    - understand their responsibility to one another as well as the conference and university’s standards of inclusion, equity, and diversity
- Conducting research (quantitative and qualitative) that measures and analyzes the impacts of the community agreement and makes recommendations
```

## What's in this toolkit 

All of these links can always be found in the menu to the left. (Individual pages' submenus will appear to the upper right for each page.)

```{dropdown} Why does this website exist? How can we use it?
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-success text-white font-weight-bold

See our <a href="https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter00_preface/introduction.html">introduction</a> and our <a href="https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter00_preface/guidelines.html">community guidelines</a>, as well as our mission on this page above.

This guide contains a [toolkit that organizers can use](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/toolkit.html) when conceiving, planning, and implementing learning events.

Here are some <a href="https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter00_preface/audience.html">examples of personas in different circumstances</a> together with suggestions for how they might use this toolkit.
```

```{dropdown} How should we form the planning committee? What should we think about well before the event?
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-success text-white font-weight-bold

See our [introduction](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/introduction.html), some [reflections upon equity and communication](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/reflections.html) and [understanding discipline-specific EDI priorities](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/disciplines.html), and an example [planning committee Code of Conduct](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/committee_conduct.html).

We also have ideas for how EDI factors into planning regarding [funding](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/funding.html), [marketing](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/marketing.html), and the [event website](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/website.html).
```

```{dropdown} What should we keep in mind before the event regarding logistics?
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-success text-white font-weight-bold

We have an [introduction and checklist](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/introduction.html), and a section on the various aspects of the [event program](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/program.html) itself.

Items to consider include [event dates](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/dates.html), [event venue](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/venue.html), [registration procedures](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/registration.html), and [training for event staff](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/training.html).
```

```{dropdown} What should we keep in mind during the event itself?
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-success text-white font-weight-bold

Again we have an [introduction and checklist](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter03_conference/introduction.html).

We have thoughts on [fostering inclusive participation](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter03_conference/inclusive_participation.html), [different types of event sessions](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter03_conference/inclusive_participation.html), and [equitable awards](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter03_conference/awards.html).
```

```{dropdown} How can we evaluate our event's EDI? How can we preserve and build upon lessons for future events?
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-success text-white font-weight-bold

Here are an [introduction and checklist](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/introduction.html), and [ways to describe the impact of EDI efforts](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/impact.html).

We have thoughts concerning [surveys of participants](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/surveys.html), [debriefing within the planning committee](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/debrief.html), and [building connections](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/building_connections.html).
```

```{dropdown} Are there some tools and templates we can use, to not reinvent the wheel?
    :container: + shadow
    :title: bg-success text-white font-weight-bold

Here are some sample [templates](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/templates/templates.html) for registration forms, budget spreadsheets, and evaluation frameworks, and a sample [multi-page report](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-multipage-report/) for qualitative and quantitative data about event EDI. We also have some widgets to record and store that information and to share it with others.
```

```{dropdown} Who made this website?

Under the direction of the Senior Advisor to the Provost on Women and Gender-Diverse Faculty, a committee representing a cross-section of faculty, staff, and graduate students from University of British Columbia, Okanagan campus (UBCO), and University of British Columbia, Vancouver campus (UBCV) has been assembled (names are listed below). We bring a diversity of backgrounds, identities, and experiences. We are committed to the work of creating the structures necessary to ensure that conferences (including panels and lecture series) held on campus, or organized by UBC community members, are equitable, diverse, strength based, and inclusive. As knowledge itself (knowledge production and sharing) is at the core of the University’s purpose, our goal is to create a community agreement with specific actions for conference planning and design.
