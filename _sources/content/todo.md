# Things to do

## Design

Right now, GitHub + Markdown is good for our collaborative authoring, but limits our options. Should we at some point collaborate with someone with experience in web design to convert our GH+MD site into a beautiful and accessible one?

- Top-level page(s)
- Update logo image
- Update header image
- Update title
- UBC [look and feel of websites](https://clf.ubc.ca)

  - UBC's [web accessibility guidelines](https://www.ubc.ca/accessibility/)
  - Stefan's email Thu May 20 and [this example](https://auditorial.withgoogle.com/accessibility-notebook)

## Sara-Jane Finlay's feedback

 - Copyediting
 - Inclusive language
   - Knowledge, expertise -> ways of knowing, experiences, etc.
   - Challenge(d) -> reduced, low, impaired, etc.
   - Vision -> conception, strategy, goal, etc.
 - "Reflection" and "prayer space": same or distinct concepts?
   - Ramadan dates: perhaps general religious holiday calendar?
 - Specific suggestions for Indigenous involvement in events: Mark cautions against being too formulaic
 - Other content clarification (for example, "shared norms with participants"; suggestion for newcomers introductory session)
