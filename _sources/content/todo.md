# For today's meeting

- Personnel: Checking in on people's bandwidth for this committee's work
- Open competition by Office of Equity and Inclusion for funds for EDI-related projects
  - Do we have ideas?
  - Is the deadline too soon?

# Things left to do

## Design

- Update logo image
- Update header image
- Update title
- Accessibility (Stefan's email Thu May 20 and [this example](https://auditorial.withgoogle.com/accessibility-notebook))
  - Right now, GitHub + Markdown is good for our collaborative authoring, but limits our options. Should we at some point collaborate with someone with experience in web design to convert our GH+MD site into a beautiful and accessible one?
- Top-level page(s)

## Sara-Jane Finlay's feedback

 - "Reflection" and "prayer space": same or distinct concepts?
   - Ramadan dates: perhaps general religious holiday calendar?
