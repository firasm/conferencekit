## Website design

Right now, GitHub + Markdown is good for our collaborative authoring, but limits our options. We hope to at some point collaborate with someone with experience in web design to convert our GH+MD site into a beautiful and accessible one.

- Top-level page(s)
- Update logo image
- Update header image
- Update title
- UBC [look and feel of websites](https://clf.ubc.ca)
  - here are [some examples](https://cms.ubc.ca/showcase/)
- Accessibilityâ€”we want to be a model to other websites, as well as listing considerations for website creators
  - UBC's [web accessibility guidelines](https://www.ubc.ca/accessibility/)
  - Stefan's email Thu May 20 and [this example](https://auditorial.withgoogle.com/accessibility-notebook)
  - [CAST's Accessibility Policy](https://www.cast.org/site/accessibility) and their [Figuration project](https://www.cast.org/products-services/products/figuration), describing "an openly licensed, feature-rich, responsive, mobile first, accessible, front-end framework to develop websites with usability and accessibility at their core from the start."
