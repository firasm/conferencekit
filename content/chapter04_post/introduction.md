# Introduction

We offer these guidelines for inclusive conferences, symposia, and learning gatherings in the hope that they will serve as building blocks for new relationships, and as reinforcements for existing ones. A core principle of the intersectional practices and commitments of Disability Justice is that access is an ongoing, dialogical process, based on care, trust, and humility. Building opportunities for representation, participation, and leadership by disabled Black, Indigenous, People of Color requires a sustained commitment to such mutually sustaining relationships, and a willingness to move away from standardization, and checklists as primary metrics of engagement.
