# Sessions

It is important to recognize the barriers that might limit the contributions of diverse groups to the knowledge sharing, learning, and networking that is a part of your event. Some participants from diverse communities (such as women, BIPOC, disabled folks) might feel tokenized or reluctant to ask questions of to speak up if they are one of only a few diverse participants. Designing and hosting an event that is welcoming and fosters diverse viewpoints and perspectives requires more than including a range of speakers, panelists, and attendees. Event planners will need to consider hidden barriers to do with power dynamics and privilege that can impede the full participation of all attendees. A survey conducted by the Oxford School of Geography and Environment found that "one third of respondents [...] said that they do not feel confident to ask questions at a conference or to network with people who are more senior than they are" (file:///Users/lailaferreira/Desktop/190522_Inclusive_Conference_Guide.pdf).
The sections here will provide suggestions for how to ensure that the conditions are established for everyone to have the opportunity to contribute to panels, discussions, Q&A and networking sessions. 

## Panel discussions and plenaries

## Q&A sessions

The following considerations for establishing an inclusive Q&A session has benefitted from the work of Eve Tuck, Associate Professor of Critical Race and Indigenous Studies at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE), University of Toronto. Eve Tuck takes an "Indigenous feminist approach to facilitating academic Q&A" (https://twitter.com/tuckeve/status/1141501422611128320).

- Ensure that the Q&A session has a clear structure and is carefully mediated for everyone to contribute. This means having a specifically assigned person to facilitate. This person should have taken the intercultural communication training and/or is experienced and knowledgable about the event values and goals in terms of inclusion and diversity. The goal is to emphasize the conference/learning event as a nonjudgemental and open exchange of ideas. 
- Provide the panel moderator or Q&A facilitator with guidelines for articulating the shared responsibility of attendees to foster a positive public speaking situation and the participation of graduate students, early career scholars, etc. This includes the quality of their questions. 
- Provide a 5-10 minute break after the presentations and before the Q&A session for people to debrief and discuss (peer review) their questions with their neighbors. Eve Tuck suggests that the moderator asks the attendees to consider: 
  - if it is a question
  - if the question is really saying that they should have given the paper
  - if the question needs to be asked in front of an audience
  - if the question is asking the speaker to do work that the question asker should be doing.
- Ask for the first question to come from a particular group (such as graduate students, Indigenous, BIPOC, women attendees, etc.)
- Ensure a positive and rich question period by asking anyone who takes the mic if their question has been peer reviewed/vetted by another attendee and if they have situated their quesiton in relation to the considerations above. 

Additional suggestions include:

- Provide opportunities for asking questions through phone apps or Twitter or other platforms.
- Provide opportunities for asking questions anonymously (with vetting).
- Make (if possible) transcripts available ahead of the panel or talk so that people have time to prepare their questions.


## Networking Sessions

Networking is often experienced as a necessary but dreaded aspect of conferences and other learning events. Attendees should all have the option to participate or to opt out. Providing structured and thoughtfully designed networking opportunities will go a long way to ensuring that everyone benefits from this important, career and research advancing, component of the event. Suggestions for conference organizers include:

- Choosing venues that foster safety if occurring away from conference venue
- Considering the networking potential of social/entertainment events such as tours of the venue or local highlights, etc.
- Scheduling sessions at various times of the day to accommodate those who cannot attend in the evenings
- Creating resources with suggested guidelines and practices and/or offer workshops on effective networking
- Establishing a buddy system between senior/experienced and junior faculty
- Providing opportunities for people to pre-book networking meetings with one or two other attendees
- Posting and reiterating conference values around inclusion and diversity at all sessions
- Planning different kinds of networking sessions such as poster sessions, "ask the expert" or "elevator pitch" themes.
- Offering stickers or badges that indicate if attendees prefer to be approached by others or if they would like some space, etc.
- Having people sign up ahead of time for coffee sessions in which they are allocated a smaller discussion group
