# Fostering Inclusive Participation

As organizers plan for the conference opening, drawing a visual to reflect the flow of participant traffic to various venues coupled with places to gather, rest, and engage in open dialogue will identify any barriers to accessibility and the degree to which the learning space promotes safe, welcoming, and  inclusive participation.  The following questions are designed to deepen dialogue among the organizing team in order for the organizers to co-design ways to foster inclusive participation from the onset of the conference/learning gathering:

- How will participants travel to the conference/learning gathering on opening day?
- What needs to be considered to ensure the conference/learning gathering is accessible to all participants on opening day and throughout the conference?
- How will diversity be represented by conference volunteers, welcome greeters or conference ambassadors? Will an Elder participate in the opening of the event and/or participate as an Elder Advisor throughout the conference?
- Will signage be accessible to participants with low vision?
- How will the signage welcome participants?  Will participants see their language represented or acknowledged? (i.e., We welcome 300 participants, representing 20 countries and diverse identities.) 
- Will signage include a statement of shared values and beliefs, fostering a greater notion of the organizers’ commitment to fostering  inclusive learning opportunities for all participants? 
- Will registration packages provide even greater clarity on expectations of participants, ensuring respect and compassion for all participants?
- As participants register, pick-up conference packages, etc., will they be advised of safe and welcoming gathering places and/or ways they can seek guidance or assistance?
- Will  feedback be welcomed or sought throughout the conference so that organizers can respond to participant concerns/challenges that arise?

## Conference Opening Welcome and Keynote Address

As participants, presenters, volunteers and community members gather for the official conference opening, organizers need to be mindful of the learning and culture that is being established at this opening event. The initial gathering will influence how participants connect with other participants (intellectually and socially) as well as their engagement with the learning opportunities throughout the conference. The following questions will enable organizers to consider how best to uphold the core values of inclusivity, equity, and diversity at the opening event:
- Will there be assigned seating at the opening event?  If so, how will the signage ensure participants understand the ‘why’ behind the assigned seating? (i.e., assigned seating for Elders, participants with accessibility needs, keynote speakers needing to be close to the stage, etc.)
- Will the opening welcome recognize and honour the diversity of speakers, participants, etc., at the conference?
- Will opening speakers represent diversity?
- Will an Indigenous Elder be asked to acknowledge the territory, or will the acknowledgement be provided by the first speaker?  
- What will attendees be told about the importance of a land acknowledgement? How will the speakers go beyond a routine acknowledgment?
- How will participants be encouraged to network, engage in the learning, seek or share advice/concerns during the conference?

## Detailing shared values

Integral to establishing shared values is an understanding and agreement on the terms and the language used that will foster a welcoming and collegial environment. This includes addressing the exclusions that we might perpetuate through our use of language as detailed in this article from the BBC: https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210330-the-harmful-ableist-language-you-unknowingly-use
