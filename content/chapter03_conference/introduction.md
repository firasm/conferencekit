# Introduction

## Fostering Inclusive Participation from the Onset 
Setting the conditions for inclusive participation begins with the way in which participants are welcomed and oriented to the conference/learning gathering. At the onset of the conference opening, participants may be required to navigate through a registration centre as well as self-select to explore conference venues, engage with conference organizers, and/or network with other participants.  Within the first hour, participants will have already begun to formulate an opinion of whether the conference/learning gathering will be a safe, inclusive, and welcoming place to learn, collaborate, and network.  Each participant’s notion of accessibility, the openness for inclusivity and respect for diversity will be influenced by what they see, feel, and hear prior to the official opening of a keynote address or session presentations.  That being said, conference organizers are encouraged to create visible signposts, promoting greater inclusivity, from the onset of the conference/learning gathering. As organizers plan for the conference opening, drawing a visual to reflect the flow of participant traffic to various venues coupled with places to gather, rest, and engage in open dialogue will identify any barriers to accessibility and the degree to which the learning space promotes safe, welcoming, and  inclusive participation.  The following questions are designed to deepen dialogue among the organizing team in order for the organizers to co-design ways to foster inclusive participation from the onset of the conference/learning gathering:

- How will participants travel to the conference/learning gathering on opening day?
- What needs to be considered to ensure the conference/learning gathering is accessible to all participants on opening day and throughout the conference?
- How will diversity be represented by conference volunteers, welcome greeters or conference ambassadors? Will an Elder participate in the opening of the event and/or participate as an Elder Advisor throughout the conference?
- Will signage be accessible to visually-challenged participants?
- How will the signage welcome participants?  Will participants see their language represented or acknowledged? (i.e., We welcome 300 participants, representing 20 countries and diverse identities.) 
- Will signage include a statement of shared values and beliefs, fostering a greater notion of the organizers’ commitment to fostering  inclusive learning opportunities for all participants? 
- Will registration packages provide even greater clarity on expectations of participants, ensuring respect and compassion for all participants?
- As participants register, pick-up conference packages, etc., will they be advised of safe and welcoming gathering places and/or ways they can seek guidance or assistance?
- Will  feedback be welcomed or sought throughout the conference so that organizers can respond to participant concerns/challenges that arise?
