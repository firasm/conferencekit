# Venue

The conference venue is integral to ensuring that the conference or learning event is welcoming, safe, and inclusive. The committee will most likely have a limited number of options and some restrictions in terms of budget and timing, but it is important to take the following logistical aspects of the event as central to the planning process. Being aware of the accessibility features and/or limitations of the venue can help you to communicate clearly to the participants and anticipate any challenges that might arise. 

## Choosing a Venue

When choosing a venue, consider the space and possible uses and barriers from as many angles as possible. In particular, you might use your analysis of the gaps and barriers in your own field (such as unconscious bias) to address who might have been excluded from participation in the past. This will most likely include racialized, Indigenous, gender diverse, and physically and invisibly disabled people as well as people who are parenting, graduate students and contract faculty on limited budgets. Consider the location of the venue as well and if the location will foster a sense of safety and security for all participants. 

- What accessibility protocols, processes, procedures, structures are already in place?
- Can the venue provide spaces for rest and reflection, family gatherings, informal connection?
- Can child care be supported either within or close to the venue?
- Are there accessible washrooms for people with a range of identities and needs?
- Will the venue allow for a barrier free flow between the events on the program schedule: or would people need to navigate inaccessible building structures, transportation, etc.?
- What kind of technical supports are provided by the venue?
- Will they provide (or can you set up) signage for directions, locations, etc. 

## Rooms

The venue's rooms for presentations, networking, entertainment, meals must be accessible to all participants. 
You will want to ensure the following:
- there are accessible means (elevators, lifts, ramps) for travelling from one room or floor to another 
- signage is provided to direct attendees (including people with sight impairments) to key rooms and events. 
- rooms are large enough for a range of mobilities such as wheelchair users
- all presenters can access the podium/stage
- large rooms have a sound system: microphones, etc.
- smaller rooms are available to use as family rooms, resting and quiet spaces
- rooms are not located near roadways, construction, mechanical equipment or have overhead lighting that creates noise and distractions that might cause disturbances for attendees.

## Washrooms

Access to washrooms will be very important to the wellbeing of the event's participants. Ensure that there are accessible washrooms for disabled individuals as well as gender neutral washrooms and facilities for anyone who has specific toileting needs (E.g. change tables). 
- If there are no gender neutral washrooms then you can create signage to assign one washroom as a gender neutral space.
- If none of the washrooms have change tables or other toileting facilities ensure there is a quiet and private room or space made available and that is clearly marked in the conference program.

## Technology

Leverage the expertise that we have all developed over the move to online events in terms of providing remote opportunities for teaching and learning, networking, and sharing knowledge. 
- Consider allocating spaces and/or technological services for streaming and/or recording events so that attendees who are unable to attend on the day can still participate.

## Transportation

When reviewing the accessibility of the venue's transportation consider people with mobility challenges (E.g. wheelchair users) as well as other conditions that might require extra planning. 

- Ensure the venue is reachable by accessible public or private transportation 
- Provide specific information and instructions on:
- the accessibility of transportation options
- suggested taxi companies, rideshare, or other safe travel options
- local protocols in hailing or booking taxis, tipping, etc.
- how to pay, where to find schedules
- hot to travel to/from airports, ports, trainstations 
- who to contact for further assistance

## Parking

When reviewing the accessibility of the venue's parking ensure that you consider people with mobility challenges (E.g. wheelchair users) as well as other conditions that might make driving the preferable option. 

Provide detailed information such as maps to the participants on the locations of accessible parking and how to navigate to the venue location.

## Food, Drink, and Entertainment

Food, drink and entertainment are integral to the social and networking opportunities of any event. It should not be difficult to accommodate dietary needs if attendee information is gathered early in the process. There are a range of reasons why someone might have dietrary restrictions such as religion/faith, pregnancy, disability, etc. See the suggested considerations below created by the University of Oxford's School of Geography and the Environment (https://reachwater.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019_05_22_Inclusive-Conference-Guide-1.pdf) 
- Collect information early about dietary needs and preferences (e.g. during the registration).
- People with specific mobility or sight impairments might need additional support during breaks, for instance to carry plates of food and drinks.
- If you are not providing meals or snacks, create a list of restaurants close to the venue that provide vegetarian/vegan/ kosher/gluten-free food, or other
options.
- If you are providing a buffet lunch, ensure that dishes/ingredients, or at least allergens, are clearly labelled.
- Ensure that not all social gatherings are alcohol or bar-centred. Offer alcohol free alternatives for drinks receptions, and caffeine-free/gluten free options for
refreshment breaks, and ensure they are labelled clearly.
- Attendees observing Ramadan will fast from sunrise to sunset. During this period, no food or drink will be consumed during daytime. If breakfast and dinners are provided at the conference, if possible, make arrangements for these attendees to eat at a later or earlier time, or discount the ticket price to allow them to make their own eating arrangements.
- Consider that round tables for dinner are more conductive to networking and conversation than long tables. If you are making a table plan, ensure that a diversity of attendees can sit together

## Lodging

Ensure that conference hotels and lodging address and ensure accessibility. Communicate these options to participants with accessibility at the forefront of all messaging.
