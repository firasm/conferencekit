## Programme Development and Speaker Selection

> We are working to build a community in which human rights are respected, and equity and inclusion are embedded in all areas of academic, work, and campus life. (UBC Equity & Inclusion Office)

The selection of speakers and presenters and the organization of the program for conferences and other learning events often contribute to the social dynamics of power that act as a barrier to a diversity of experiences, knowledges, and contributions to the university and individual disciplines. We often have implicit biases that require us to take a step back and to look at established cultures and processes from different perspectives. Are all members of the planning committee invited to offer their perspectives and experiences on how the process might be more equitable and inclusive? The following suggestions are intended to support the planning committee in addressing these often-hidden barriers within and across academic institutional structures that might impede the academic community from achieving its fullest potential.
