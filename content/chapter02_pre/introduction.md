# Introduction

As the planning committee works together to make decisions about the venue, dates and times, and other event logistics, it is important to keep the purpose of the event at the forefront (I.e. sharing of diverse knowledges, collaboration, and relationship building). Focus your approach on valuing diversity and fostering the full, barrier-free participation of all contributors and attendees. As noted in the introduction, not everyone can be accommodated at all times. This is a process. Committing to creating a professional learning environment that is welcoming and supportive on a practical/logistical level is integral to the foundations of an inclusive and equitable event that benefits everyone. 

## Pre-Conference Communication

Fostering inclusive participation starts with the initial messaging to potential participants. As organizers, how will you reach out to equity-deserving groups in ways that possible registrants recognize your commitment to inclusivity, accessibility, and equity? At this point, the organizing committee might want/need to revisit the appropriate terminology and language to use for equity deserving groups. 

From initial announcements of when the registration will open to your early descriptions of the conference/learning gathering, it is critical that your messaging reflects your commitment to designing an accessible conference/learning gathering where a diversity of identities is valued, expected, and respected, and where diversity of ways of knowing, scholarly research, and beliefs and perspectives is integral to fulsome participant engagement and deepening the learning experience.

## Initial Messaging Examples

We could put some examples here of successful initial messaging.

## Pre-Conference Community Building

In addition to messaging, consider how you can build community for the event participants before the start date. This might include a pre-conference social event designed to welcome new or early career participants.
