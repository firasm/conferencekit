# Designing Inclusive Conferences and Learning Gatherings

Our ultimate goal is to build and sustain institutional capacity for welcoming and retaining researchers, educators, community members, and students from equity-deserving groups. As well, our mission is to center such people in positions of leadership and partnerships from which they have been (and, too often, continue to be) excluded.

We recognize this process requires us to begin with the foundations of institutional structures across and within disciplines and units. The core of our mission is to ensure that learning events (conferences, seminars, congresses, symposiums, etc.) associated with UBC are designed to foster a diversity of knowledges, identities, and experiences that contribute to all fields and conversations. We commit to do the following:

- Establish specific actions for reconciliation, including decolonizing educational methodologies and practices and holding space for Indigenous perspectives and knowledges from Indigenous peoples;
- Identify and remove barriers for equity-deserving groups and individuals
- Identify leaders and partners, and create a forum for equity-deserving groups to contribute their lived experiences [2](https://www.sinsinvalid.org/news-1/2020/6/8/access-suggestions-for-public-events)
- Create and provide resources for conference organizers to recognize and centre the diverse lived experiences, needs, and aspirations of participants
- Create and provide resources for conference organizers on issues related to diversity, and the benefits for inclusion across the institution, and within disciplines
- Design conferences that are inclusive, including an environment in which all participants:
    - have the freedom to learn and share knowledge and experiences
    - have access to spaces, supports, and tools needed for that freedom
    - understand their responsibility to one another as well as the conference and universityâ€™s standards of inclusion, equity, and diversity
- Conduct research (quantitative and qualitative) that measures and analyzes the impacts of the community agreement and makes recommendations

As part of this process, we are asking for community feedback on what you think is needed to create inclusive and diverse conferences, panels, and speakers at UBC. We hope you participate and partner with us on this journey to advance inclusion and equitable access at UBC.

# Toolkit

In addition to a description of [why these guidelines are needed](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter00_preface/guidelines.html) and the [philosophy behind them](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter00_preface/introduction.html), this guide contains a [toolkit that organizers can use](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/toolkit.html) when conceiving, planning, and implement learning events.
